## What is this?

Here we explore weather we need to use the DetectBeadSubstitutionErrors and DetectBeadSynthesisErrors functions from the DropseqTools pipeline.

The original description of the DropseqTool package can be found here: [https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/blob/v2.3.0/doc/Drop-seq_Alignment_Cookbook.pdf](https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/blob/v2.3.0/doc/Drop-seq_Alignment_Cookbook.pdf)

This folder contains the code for exploring issue #11.
